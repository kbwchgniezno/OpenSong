.CAPO 2
.Em                        G
 Got a feeling that I really need to let go
.C               D                 Em
 Of everything that’s weighing me down
.                     G
 Gotta listen to the voice that I know
.C                  D
 You speak to me and say

[c1]
.    Em   G   C  D
 I’m free
. Em            G                        
 Nothing gonna hold me down
.  C             D          Em   G   C  D              
 Cause You keep setting me free
. Em            G             
 I can feel it all around
.  C              D          Em 
 Cause in Your presence, I’m free

[b1]
.Em          G D  Em x2
 Oh, Oh, Ohn
 

[v2]
.Em                      G
 When I think of how my life has been changed
.C                   D           Em
 It all comes down to being with You
                         G
 And I know that You are always with me
.C                    D
 Lord, I believe with You

 
[b2]
 Em        G                  C             D
 I’m gonna praise You with my hands raised high
 Em        G                  C            D
 I’m gonna praise You with my hands raised high
 Em       G                  C            D
 I’m gonna praise You with my hands raisеd high
 Em        G                C              D
 I’m gonna praise You with my hands raised high
